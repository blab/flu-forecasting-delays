\section{Methods and Materials}

\subsection{Estimating and assigning submission delays}

We estimated the delay between sample collection and submission of A/H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences to the GISAID database \citep{gisaid} by calculating the difference in GISAID-annotated submission date and collection date in days for samples collected between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020 and with a submission date prior to October 1, 2020.
We selected this period of time as representative of modern genomic surveillance efforts prior to changes in circulation patterns of influenza caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Of the 104,392 HA sequences in GISAID, 11,222 (11\%) were collected during this period with a mean submission delay of 98 days ($\sim$3 months) and a median delay of 74 days.
Only 11\% of sequences (N=1,210) were submitted within 4 weeks of collection, and only 36\% (N=4,057) were submitted within 8 weeks (Figure~\ref{fig:model_of_delays_and_horizons}A, purple).

We modeled the shape of the observed delay distribution as a gamma distribution using a maximum likelihood fit from SciPy 1.10.1 \citep{scipy}.
With this approach, we estimated a shape parameter of 1.76, a scale parameter of 53.18, and location parameter of 3.98.
The product of these shape and scale values corresponded to a mean delay of 93.76 days (Figure~\ref{fig:model_of_delays_and_horizons}A, green).
To assign realistic submission delays to each sample in our analysis, we randomly sampled from this gamma distribution and calculated a ``realistic submission date'' by adding the sampled delay in days to the observed collection date.

Based on the observed rapid submission of SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first years of the pandemic, we expected that an achievable ``ideal'' submission delay for seasonal influenza sequences would have a 1-month average delay instead of the observed $\sim$3-month delay from the pre-pandemic period.
We modeled this ideal submission delay distribution by dividing the gamma shape parameter by 3 to get a value of 0.59 and a corresponding mean delay of 31.25 days (Figure~\ref{fig:model_of_delays_and_horizons}A, orange).
This approach effectively shifted the realistic gamma toward zero, while maintaining the relatively longer upper tail of the distribution.
To assign ideal submission delays to each sample in our analysis, we randomly sampled from this modified gamma distribution and added the sampled delay in days to the observed collection date.
Additionally, we required that each sample's ``ideal'' delay be less than or equal to its ``realistic'' delay.
